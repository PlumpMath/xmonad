# my Xmonad configuration

This is rather simple Xmonad configuration with KDE integration (would also work
standalone) based on default one shipped with Fedora as well as these
examples:

 * [Using xmonad in KDE](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_KDE)
 * [John Goerzen's Configuration](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen's_Configuration)
